## Morse Code Input
  - Another badUI, this one attempts to solve the issue of unusable keyboards by giving the user the ability to write text using morse code. 
  - The . button inputs dots, the - button inputs dashes(obviously)
  - Press enter to translate the current code fragment into a string


## Usage
  - Bootstrapped with Create-React-App, so usage is simple.
  - clone the repo to your local machine and ```cd``` into the root directory
  - Run ```npm install``` to install dependencies
  - Run ```npm start``` to initialize the application
