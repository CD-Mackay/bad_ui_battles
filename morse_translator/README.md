## Morse Code Translator
  - A sister project to the morse code input App, I made this project because I enjoyed learning about morse code

## Features
  - This application allows a user to convert strings into a string representing morse code, and vice versa

## Usage
  - Clone the repo to your local directory
  - run ```npm install``` to install dependencies
  - run ```npm start``` to open the app
  - Type your message into the first textbox to convert a string to morse code. 
  - The second textbox can be used to convert morse messages back into english.
