# Welcome to Which_Account
  - This sample login form is inspired by the balance between user-friendly login forms and security.

## Usage
  - CD into the "which_account" folder, run ```npm install``` to install dependencies, and ```npm start``` to run the app
  - Premade accounts either use the password "password", "pass", or "word". Type any into the password field to see how this user authentication works.
